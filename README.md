Anthony S. Hopson:
I am a software developer and have worked in the industry since the late 1980's. I have worked on a variety of projects and in a variety of environments.
The first language I learned was IBM 370 Assembler though I have not used it since school. I later taught myself FORTRAN and a little COBOL. While working at the USLC Graduate School of Management I learned C on an HP-UX machine. We were the first shop in the country to migrate from HP MPE to HP-UX.
